ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marius

O.o before we talk o.O -> https://youtu.be/c6mVl6fAxLw?t=3  <- O.o

Email: /coming soon!/

You go outside (if you're already outside - PERFECT!) go to the nearest bus or train station. There you get on for the next three stations. From there you walk home again and in the meantime you think about what to prepare to eat for your loved ones. After you have arrived at home and made the meal, you sit down on the computer and simply write me a message on Github directly. Please don't forget to do the jumping jacks before you get on the bus/train.
Thank you for trying to contact me.
